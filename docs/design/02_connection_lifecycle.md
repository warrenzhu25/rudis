## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Problem
Traditional in-memory datastores encounter severe scalability barriers on modern multi-core, high-throughput cloud hardware. Single-threaded architectures (such as Redis) saturate a single CPU core while leaving the remaining 95%+ of server cores idle. Multi-threaded mutex architectures (such as Memcached) suffer from heavy spinlock contention, CPU cache line bouncing, and global memory allocator lock bottlenecks.

### 1.2 The Rudis Solution
Rudis implements the **Thread-Per-Core (Shared-Nothing)** architectural paradigm natively on Linux `io_uring` via Monoio. Each physical CPU core owns its own isolated event loop, its own thread-local memory database, and its own kernel `SO_REUSEPORT` listener. Operations on local keys execute in nanoseconds with zero locks, zero atomic operations, and zero cross-core cache invalidations.

## 2. Contributor Mental Model & Architectural Principles

### 2.1 The Mental Model
A connection spends its entire lifetime pinned to the worker core that accepted it. It reads RESP command frames in batches, groups them by destination shard (pipeline squashing), and executes local commands inline with zero channel hops.

### 2.2 Design Rationale (The "Why")
In pipelined workloads, dispatching requests key-by-key across threads incurs O(K) inter-thread round-trips. Pipeline squashing buckets commands by target shard and sends one single batched message per remote core, slashing channel hops and socket write syscalls.

### 2.3 Key Invariants & Concurrency Constraints (Non-Negotiable Rules)
1. **Pure Single-Threaded Client State**: Every connection is handled exclusively by the
   core that accepted it (`handle_connection`'s locals — `in_multi`, `tx_queue`, `asking`,
   `authenticated`, `auth_user` — are plain stack variables, no `Arc`/`Mutex`).
2. **Blocking Commands Force an Immediate Flush First**: Before executing a command like
   `BLPOP` that may suspend the task for up to its timeout, `handle_connection` flushes any
   already-buffered responses to the socket first — otherwise earlier pipelined replies would
   sit unsent for the entire blocking duration.
3. **Cross-Shard Transactions Use Explicit Locks**: A `MULTI`/`EXEC` block whose queued
   commands touch more than one shard acquires a distributed "VLL" (very-lightweight-locking)
   lock across every touched shard before running the batch, and releases it after — see §4.2.
4. **Squashing Is Gated on More Than Just Routability**: The pipeline-squashing fast path
   (`execute_commands_squashed`) additionally requires the client to already be authenticated,
   have real ACL permission for each command and its key, and (for keyed commands) that this
   node's cluster-gossip table actually confirms ownership of the key's slot — not merely that
   the slot's local `SlotState` is `Stable` — see §4.4.
5. **Non-Blocking Cross-Shard Dispatch**: Remote-shard work is always sent as a
   `ShardMessage::Batch` over pre-allocated `flume` channels and awaited without blocking the
   reactor thread — other connections on the same core keep making progress.

## 4. Performance Guarantees & Theoretical Complexity

- **Pre-allocated responder pool, not one-shot channels**: `ResponderChannel`s are built once
  per connection (`(0..router.num_shards).map(|_| flume::bounded(1))`) and reused for every
  pipeline flush — still the mechanism behind zero-allocation steady-state cross-shard fan-out.
- **`CompactResp` replies**: batched remote responses are carried as `CompactResp` rather than
  a plain `Vec<u8>`, reducing per-reply allocation/copy overhead in the squashed path.
- **Command-name lowercasing/stat tracking is not free**: every executed command updates a
  global `CMD_STATS` map (`record_cmd_stat`) under a `RwLock`, plus per-client `last_cmd`
  bookkeeping — real but modest fixed overhead paid on every command, not just squashed
  batches.
- **`MGET`/`MSET` now genuinely parallelize across shards** (§4.6) via pooled channels and a
  spin-then-block harvest, closing what was previously the single biggest cost on multi-shard
  multi-key workloads — bounded by the slowest remote shard's response time now, not by the
  sum of every remote shard's response time.
- **The spin-then-block harvest trades CPU for latency, with a fairness cost worth naming**:
  up to 128 non-blocking `try_recv` sweeps (`std::hint::spin_loop()` between them) happen
  *without yielding to `monoio`'s cooperative scheduler* — on this shared-nothing,
  single-threaded-per-core design, that means other connections' tasks on the *same core*
  make no progress while an `MGET`/`MSET` is in its spin phase. Fine when remote shards
  reply within microseconds (the common case this was tuned for); a burst of concurrent
  `MGET`/`MSET` calls each waiting on a genuinely slow remote shard could measurably delay
  unrelated connections sharing that core until the 128-iteration cap is hit and each falls
  back to a real `.await`.
