## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Problem
Traditional in-memory datastores encounter severe scalability barriers on modern multi-core, high-throughput cloud hardware. Single-threaded architectures (such as Redis) saturate a single CPU core while leaving the remaining 95%+ of server cores idle. Multi-threaded mutex architectures (such as Memcached) suffer from heavy spinlock contention, CPU cache line bouncing, and global memory allocator lock bottlenecks.

### 1.2 The Rudis Solution
Rudis implements the **Thread-Per-Core (Shared-Nothing)** architectural paradigm natively on Linux `io_uring` via Monoio. Each physical CPU core owns its own isolated event loop, its own thread-local memory database, and its own kernel `SO_REUSEPORT` listener. Operations on local keys execute in nanoseconds with zero locks, zero atomic operations, and zero cross-core cache invalidations.

## 2. Contributor Mental Model & Architectural Principles

### 2.1 The Mental Model
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types for active-active multi-region replication. Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) provide causal ordering without dependency on synchronized physical clocks.

### 2.2 Design Rationale (The "Why")
Cross-region replication cannot rely on global consensus without incurring multi-hundred-millisecond write latencies. CRDTs allow local writes to commit instantly and merge deterministically across regions.

### 2.3 Key Invariants & Concurrency Constraints (Non-Negotiable Rules)
1. **Deterministic Convergence (real, and tested)**: `LwwRegister::merge`, `OrSet::merge`,
   and `PnCounter::merge` are each commutative/idempotent by construction (see §4) — the
   file's own `#[cfg(test)]` module (`test_lww_register_convergence`,
   `test_pn_counter_convergence`, `test_orset_add_wins`) exercises exactly this.
2. **HLC via lock-free CAS, not a mutex**: `HybridLogicalClock` stores
   `latest_physical_ms: AtomicU64` / `latest_logical: AtomicU32` and advances them with a
   compare-exchange retry loop (§4.1) — real lock-free code, not a fabrication.
3. **Add-Wins semantics for `OrSet`**: a concurrent add and remove of the same element
   resolve in favor of the add, because `remove` only tombstones the specific add-tags
   (`HlcTimestamp`s) it has *observed so far* — a later add carries a fresh tag the remove
   never saw, so it survives merge. Verified by `test_orset_add_wins`.
4. **No consensus, because there's no network layer to reach consensus over**: with sync
   entirely manual (§1), there's no Paxos/Raft and also no automatic conflict detection —
   whoever runs `CRDT.MERGE` decides when and with what payload merging happens.

## 3. High-Level Architecture & Workflow Diagram

```
Region US-East (Write k=v1 at HLC_1) ──┐
                                              ├──► Deterministic LWW Merge
       Region EU-West (Write k=v2 at HLC_2) ──┘    (HLC_2 > HLC_1 wins)
```

## 4. Performance Guarantees & Theoretical Complexity

- **Lock-free clock advancement**: `HybridLogicalClock::now`/`update` use CAS retry loops,
  not a mutex — cheap even under contention from multiple connections on the same shard.
- **Export is O(total CRDT state size) and single-threaded**: `export_sync_payload` builds
  one `Vec<u8>` for the *entire* store in one call; there's no incremental/delta export —
  every `CRDT.DUMP` re-serializes everything currently held.
- **No network cost inside Rudis**: since sync is manual (§1), there's no WAN traffic,
  retry logic, or delta-batching to account for here at all — that cost (if any) lives
  entirely in whatever external process actually transports the dump/merge payloads.
